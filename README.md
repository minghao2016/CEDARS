Overview
--------

CEDARS is a computational paradigm for collection and aggregation of time-to-event data in retrospective clinical studies. Born out of a practical need for a more efficient way to conduct medical research, it aims to systematize and accelerate the review of electronic health record (EHR) corpora. It accomplishes those goals by deploying natural language processing (NLP) as a tool to assist detection and characterization of clinical events by human abstractors. In its current iteration, CEDARS is avalaible as an open-source R package under GPL-3 license.
