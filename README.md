Overview
--------

CEDARS (Clinical Event Detection and Recording System) is a computational paradigm for collection and aggregation of time-to-event data in retrospective clinical studies. Born out of a practical need for a more efficient way to conduct medical research, it aims to systematize and accelerate the review of electronic health record (EHR) corpora. It accomplishes those goals by deploying natural language processing (NLP) as a tool to assist detection and characterization of clinical events by human abstractors. In its current iteration, CEDARS is avalaible as an open-source R package under GPL-3 license.

Requirements
------------

R 3.5.0 and package dependencies<br>
RStudio<br>
MongoDB
Universal Medical Language System (UMLS) MRCONSO.RRF file (desirable but not required)

CEDARS can be installed locally or on a server. In the latter case, Shiny Server (open source or commercial version) will be required. A business-grade server installation of MongoDB is vastly preferred, even if CEDARS is run locally. Because by definition CEDARS handles protected health informsation (PHI), special consideration should be given to ensure HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliance, including but not limited to using HTTPS, encryption at rest, minimum password requirements and limiting operation to within institutional firewalls when indicated. **CEDARS is provided as-is with no guarantee whatsoever and users agree to be held responsible for compliance with their local government/institutional regulations.** All CEDARS installations should be reviewed with institutional information security authorities.

The UMLS is a rich compendium of biomedical lexicons. It is maintained by the National Institutes of Health and requires establishing an account in order to access the associated files. Those files are not included with the CEDARS R package, but CEDARS is designed to use them natively so individual users can easily include them in their annotation pipeline.

Operational Schema
------------------

CEDARS is modular and all information for any given annotation project is stored in one MongoDB database. User credentials, original clinical notes, NLP annotations and patient-specific information are stored in dedicated collections. Once clinical notes have been uploaded, they are passed through the NLP pipeline. Currently only UDPipe is supported and integrated with CEDARS. If desired, the annotations pipeline will include medical negation by means of NegEx (Stud Health Technol Inform. 2013; 192: 677â€“681. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23920642/) and UMLS concept unique identifier (CUI) tags.
